# Biological neuronal network simulations with Python

## Available images:

- simulation: NEST 2.12, NEURON 7.4, and PyNN 0.9 and the scientific Python stack
  - For **Python 3** use the [master branch](https://github.com/NeuralEnsemble/neuralensemble-docker/tree/master/simulation)
  - For **Python 2** use the [python2 branch](https://github.com/NeuralEnsemble/neuralensemble-docker/tree/python2/simulation)
- simulationx: like "simulation", but with support for X11 forwarding over SSH
  - For **Python 3** use the [master branch](https://github.com/NeuralEnsemble/neuralensemble-docker/tree/master/simulationx)
  - For **Python 2** use the [python2 branch](https://github.com/NeuralEnsemble/neuralensemble-docker/tree/python2/simulationx)
